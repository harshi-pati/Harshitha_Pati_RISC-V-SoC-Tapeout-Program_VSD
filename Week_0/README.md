## 📖 About This Journey

This repository is my personal logbook of the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**.

The goal:

> To go from **RTL design** all the way to **tapeout-ready GDSII**, using only open-source tools — and in the process, contribute to one of India’s largest collaborative silicon design initiatives.

```
📝 RTL Design → 🔄 Synthesis → 🏗️ Physical Design → 🎯 Tapeout
```

## 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools

<details>
<summary><b>🛠️ My Foundation Week (Tool Installation)</b></summary>  

This week was all about **setting up the playground**: preparing my Ubuntu system and installing the tools that power the RTL-to-GDSII flow.

## 📦 Tools Installed

| Tool               | Purpose                                  | 
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Yosys**          | RTL synthesis & logic optimization       | 
| **Icarus Verilog** | Verilog simulation & testbench support   | 
| **GTKWave**        | Waveform viewer for simulation results   | 

### 🌟 Key Takeaways

* First hands-on with **open-source EDA tools**
* Learned the importance of **environment setup for smooth flows**
* Prepared my system with **6GB RAM / 4 vCPUs / 50GB HDD** for EDA workloads

## 🎯 Program Scope (In My Words)

* **What I’ll Learn:** SoC design from scratch → synthesis → physical design → tapeout
* **Tools I’ll Use:** Yosys, OpenLane, Magic, GTKWave, Ngspice, Icarus Verilog
* **Why It Matters:** Brings real-world chip design workflows into open-source
* **Community:** Part of a 3500+ participant collaboration across India
* **Impact:** Strengthening India’s semiconductor ecosystem through hands-on silicon design

---

## 🎤 Sessions That Inspired Me

* **Dr. Rajat Moona** – Keynote on the vision of RISC-V in India
* **Samir Patel** – Insights on bridging academia and industry
* **Mohamed Kassem** – Technical deep dive into open-source tapeouts

---

## 🛠️ My Destination

All this learning will converge into designing a **custom RISC-V development board (VSD Squadron)** — a silicon proof of what open collaboration can achieve.
